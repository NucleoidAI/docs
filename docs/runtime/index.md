# Runtime

# Introduction

Nucleoid is an open source (Apache 2.0), runtime environment for declarative programming in JavaScript. Nucleoid runtime rerenders and tracks JavaScript statements in the graph and stores its state under a single process. This model dramatically reduces number of codes for the same job and since the runtime combines data and logic, external database is no longer needed.

> The main object of the Nucleoid project is to manage data and logic under the same process.

<u>Applying declarative programming at the runtime</u> gives us ability to combine logic and data that organically reduces number of code lines as well as complexity of the system, which makes a great alternative to the low-code solution.
