## What is Nucleoid?

Nucleoid is a low-code framework, which uses symbolic AI, tracks given statements in JavaScript and creates
relationships between variables, objects, and functions etc. in the graph. So, as writing just like any other codes in
Node.js, the runtime translates your business logic to fully working application by managing the JS state as well as
storing in the built-in data store, so that your application doesn't require external database or anything else.

### ..but why?

Even simple applications today require lots of coding, libraries, tuning etc., and the majority of them are technical
requirements rather than business logic. The declarative programming approach used by Nucleoid abstracts away the
technical details and allows developers to write code that expresses the desired behavior without needing to worry
about low-level implementation details.

Nucleoid reduces the number of code lines required to build an application by providing a declarative runtime
environment. The environment allows developers to declaratively describe the behavior of their program, rather than
writing out all the technical instructions required to implement the behavior. This means that developers can focus on
defining the desired behavior of their program, rather than writing low-level technical instructions,
leading to more concise and manageable code, which also aligns with modern software development methodologies that focus
on functional requirements and encapsulating technical details.

## Hello World

```javascript
const nucleoid = require("nucleoidjs");
const app = nucleoid();

class Item {
  constructor(name, barcode) {
    this.name = name;
    this.barcode = barcode;
  }
}
nucleoid.register(Item);

// 👍 Only needed a business logic and 💖
// "Create an item with given name and barcode,
// but the barcode must be unique"
app.post("/items", (req) => {
  const barcode = req.body.barcode;

  const check = Item.find((i) => i.barcode === barcode);

  if (check) {
    throw "DUPLICATE_BARCODE";
  }

  return new Item(name, barcode);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

You run your business logic and successfully persisted your object only with this :point_up_2:

> Just the reminder, you don't need external database, `const app = nucleoid()` will do the magic.

## Setting up

Nucleoid runtime runs top of Node.js, it can be installed as a npm package:

```shell
> npm i nucleoidjs
```

Initialize the runtime with this:

```javascript
const nucleoid = require("nucleoidjs");
const app = nucleoid();
```

> :bulb: The runtime uses local files for internal data management, and stores every statement locally. This clears local data:
>
> ```shell
> > npx nucleoidjs clear
> ```

## Variables

As defined in JavaScript, variables of `var`, `let` and `const` can be used, but only difference is `var` is stored automatically,
in meanwhile, `let` and `const` are temporary to its block

```javascript
app.post("/test", () => {
  var a = 1;
  return a;
});

app.get("/test", () => {
  return a;
});
```

> :bulb: Variable definitions without identifier like `a = 1` are upsert operation, also automatically stored.

## Class

Classes require to be registered before used in Nucleoid:

```javascript
class Order {
  constructor(item, qty) {
    this.item = item;
    this.qty = qty;
  }
}

nucleoid.register(Order);
```

## Objects

The same thing for objects, once initiated and assigned to the `var` variable as well as it stored.

```javascript
app.post("/orders", () => {
  var order = new Order("ITEM-123", 3);
  return order;
});
```

and it can retrieve by its `var` variable as mentioned earlier.

```javascript
app.get("/orders", () => {
  return order;
});
```

```json
{
  "id": "order0",
  "item": "ITEM-123",
  "qty": 3
}
```

if object initiated without assigning `var` variable, the runtime automatically assign `var` variable along with `id`

```javascript
app.post("/test", () => new Order("ITEM-123", 3));
```

```json
{
  "id": "order0",
  "item": "ITEM-123",
  "qty": 3
}
```

> :bulb: `id` of object is always the same to its global `var` so that either can be used to retrieve the object like
> `Order["order0"]` and `order0`.

<br />

if object assigned to either `let` or `const`, the runtime will create `var` variable the same as its `id`

```javascript
app.post("/orders", () => {
  const order = new Order("ITEM-123", 3);
  return order;
});
```

```json
{
  "id": "order1",
  "item": "ITEM-123",
  "qty": 3
}
```

Now, it can use its `id` as `var` in order to retrieve the object

```javascript
app.get("/test", () => order1);
```

## Properties

Properties can be defined as part of its `var`, and it will store along with object.

```javascript
app.post("/test", () => {
  var order = new Order("ITEM-123", 3);
  order.details = "some details";
  return order;
});
```

<br />

or it can be part of `let` or `const`

```javascript
app.post("/test", () => {
  const order = new Order("ITEM-123", 3);
  order.details = "some details";
  return order;
});
```

<br />

They will be part of JSON when retrieved as in standard JavaScript

```javascript
app.get("/test", () => order1);
```

```json
{
  "id": "order1",
  "item": "ITEM-123",
  "qty": 3,
  "details": "some details"
}
```

or can be part of constructor as seen in previous examples

```javascript
class Order {
  constructor(item, qty) {
    this.item = item;
    this.qty = qty;
  }
}
nucleoid.register(Order);

app.post("/test", () => new Order("ITEM-123", 3));
```

## Query

Once a class registered, the runtime creates list of instance under its name. For example:

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(username) {
    this.username = username;
    this.active = true;
    this.created = Date.now();
  }
}
nucleoid.register(User);

// Retrieves active users    👇
app.get("/users", () => User.filter((u) => u.active == true));

// Retrieves the student     👇
app.get("/users", () => User.find((u) => u.username == "canmingir"));
```

or lodash functions can be used :partying_face:

```javascript
app.get("/users", () => _.map(User, (u) => ({ x: u.username })));
```

## Scope

Nucleoid can be used without built-in API routes as well, but in order to do that, outside data needs to pass in as a
scope in your project an call `nucleoid.run( fn )` and it will return the value.

```javascript
const scope = { userId: "USER-1" };
const user = nucleoid.run((scope) => new User(scope.userId), scope);
console.log(user);
```

## Terminal

Nucleoid also opens terminal channel at `8448` port for queries like in SQL, so that you can write code snippet for data operations
