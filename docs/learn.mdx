## Introduction

Nucleoid is **D**eclarative (**L**ogic) **R**untime **E**nvironment. D(L)RE functions as a reasoning engine by implementing symbolic AI through declarative (logic-based) programming. Nucleoid runtime tracks given statements in JavaScript and creates relationships between variables, objects, and functions etc. in the logic graph. In brief, the runtime translates your business logic into a fully functioning application by managing the JavaScript state and utilizing a built-in data store, so you don't need an external database or anything else.

## What is Neuro-Symbolic AI?

Neuro-Symbolic AI is an emerging field that combines two major approaches in artificial intelligence: neural networks and symbolic AI. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each component represents and how they're integrated in neuro-symbolic AI:

- Neural Networks: These are a cornerstone of deep learning, which mimics the human brain's interconnected neuron structure to process data. Neural networks excel at handling raw data inputs, learning from vast amounts of data, and identifying patterns. They are particularly good at tasks like image recognition, speech processing, and language translation.
- Symbolic AI: This approach involves the use of high-level, human-readable symbols to represent problems and logic to solve them. Symbolic AI is based on rules and knowledge representation, making it excellent for reasoning, planning, and executing tasks that require a clear, defined set of rules or knowledge base.

### Neural Networks: The Learning Component

Neural networks are highly effective at identifying patterns, relationships, and characteristics within extensive datasets. These networks excel in tasks related to classification, prediction, and recognizing patterns, making them especially useful for handling unstructured data like images, text, and audio. Through their ability to learn from examples, neural networks can generalize and grasp intricate data structures and subtle variations in the data.

### Symbolic AI: The Reasoning Component

The symbolic component of Neuro-Symbolic AI focuses on logic, rules, and symbolic representations of knowledge. Unlike neural networks that learn from data, symbolic AI uses predefined rules and knowledge bases to perform reasoning, make inferences, and understand relationships between entities. This aspect of AI is transparent, interpretable, and capable of explaining its decisions and reasoning processes in a way that humans can understand.

### Declarative Logic in Symbolic Reasoning

Declarative logic is a subset of declarative programming, a style of building programs that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. In declarative logic, you state the facts and rules that define the problem domain. The runtime environment or the system itself figures out how to satisfy those conditions or how to apply those rules to reach a conclusion. This contrasts with imperative programming, where the developer writes code that describes the exact steps to achieve a goal.

Symbolic reasoning refers to the process of using symbols to represent problems and applying logical rules to manipulate these symbols and derive conclusions or solutions. In AI and computer science, it involves using symbolic representations for entities and actions, enabling the system to perform logical inferences, decision making, and problem-solving based on the rules and knowledge encoded in the symbols.

By integrating Nucleoid into Neuro-Symbolic AI, the system benefits from enhanced interpretability and reliability. The declarative logic and rules defined in Nucleoid provide clear explanations for the AI's decisions, making it easier for users to understand and trust the system's outputs. Furthermore, the explicit reasoning capabilities help ensure that decisions are made based on logical principles, adding a layer of reliability and consistency to the AI's behavior.

> 'The user requested to define a human with a name using a declarative class'

---

// Ubiquitous Code:
'use declarative';

class Human {
  name: string;
  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

```javascript
User:

Assistant: All humans are mortal
> 'All humans were declared as mortal.'

---

// Ubiquitous Code:
'use declarative';

$Human.mortal = true;
```

Assistant:
> 'A human named 'Socrates' was successfully created.'

---

// Ubiquitous Code:
'use imperative';

var human1 = new Human('Socrates');

// Result: {"id":"human1","name":"Socrates","mortal":true}
```

```javascript
User:
> 'Is human with name 'Socrates' mortal?'

Assistant:
> 'The human named 'Socrates' was determined to be mortal.'

---

// Ubiquitous Code:
`use imperative`;

var human1 = new Human('Socrates');
human1.mortal;
// Result: true
```

> :bulb: This executes the business logic and stores the state in the data store. `const app = nucleoid()` manages internal data store without requiring an external database.

## Setting up

Nucleoid runtime runs top of Node.js, it can be installed as a npm package:

```shell
> npm i nucleoidai
```

Initialize the runtime with this:

```javascript
const nucleoid = require("nucleoidai");
const app = nucleoid();
```

> :bulb: The runtime uses local files for internal data management, and stores every statement locally. This clears local data:
>
> ```shell
> > npx nucleoidai clear
> ```

## Variables

As defined in JavaScript, variables of `var`, `let` and `const` can be used, but only difference is `var` is stored automatically,
in meanwhile, `let` and `const` are temporary to its block

Terminal:

```shell
> var a = 1;
> a
1
```

API:

```javascript
app.post("/test", () => {
  var a = 1;
  return a;
});

app.get("/test", () => {
  return a;
});
```

> :bulb: Variable definitions without identifier like `a = 1` are upsert operation, also automatically stored.

## Class

Classes require to be registered before used in Nucleoid:

Terminal:

```shell
> class Order {
    constructor(item, qty) {
      this.item = item;
      this.qty = qty;
    }
  }
```

API:

```javascript
class Order {
  constructor(item, qty) {
    this.item = item;
    this.qty = qty;
  }
}

nucleoid.register(Order);
```

## Objects

The same thing for objects, once initiated and assigned to the `var` variable as well as it stored.

Terminal:

```shell
> var order = new Order("ITEM-123", 3);
> order
{ id: 'order0', item: 'ITEM-123', qty: 3 }
```

API:

```javascript
app.post("/orders", () => {
  var order = new Order("ITEM-123", 3);
  return order;
});
```

and it can retrieve by its `var` variable as mentioned earlier.

Terminal:

```shell
> order
{ id: 'order0', item: 'ITEM-123', qty: 3 }
```

API:

```javascript
app.get("/orders", () => {
  return order;
});
```

```json
{
  "id": "order0",
  "item": "ITEM-123",
  "qty": 3
}
```

if object initiated without assigning `var` variable, the runtime automatically assign `var` variable along with `id`

Terminal:

```shell
> new Order("ITEM-123", 3)
{ id: 'order1', item: 'ITEM-123', qty: 3 }
```

API:

```javascript
app.post("/test", () => new Order("ITEM-123", 3));
```

```json
{
  "id": "order0",
  "item": "ITEM-123",
  "qty": 3
}
```

> :bulb: `id` of object is always the same to its global `var` so that either can be used to retrieve the object like
> `Order["order0"]` and `order0`.

<br />

if object assigned to either `let` or `const`, the runtime will create `var` variable the same as its `id`

Terminal:

```shell
> const order = new Order("ITEM-123", 3);
> order
{ id: 'order2', item: 'ITEM-123', qty: 3 }
```

API:

```javascript
app.post("/orders", () => {
  const order = new Order("ITEM-123", 3);
  return order;
});
```

```json
{
  "id": "order1",
  "item": "ITEM-123",
  "qty": 3
}
```

Now, it can use its `id` as `var` in order to retrieve the object

Terminal:

```shell
> order1
{ id: 'order2', item: 'ITEM-123', qty: 3 }
```

API:

```javascript
app.get("/test", () => order1);
```

## Properties

Properties can be defined as part of its `var`, and it will store along with object.

Terminal:

```shell
> var order = new Order("ITEM-123", 3);
> order.details = "some details";
> order
{ id: 'order0', item: 'ITEM-123', qty: 3, details: 'some details' }
```

API:

```javascript
app.post("/test", () => {
  var order = new Order("ITEM-123", 3);
  order.details = "some details";
  return order;
});
```

<br />

or it can be part of `let` or `const`

Terminal:

```shell
> const order = new Order("ITEM-123", 3);
> order.details = "some details";
> order
{ id: 'order1', item: 'ITEM-123', qty: 3, details: 'some details' }
```

API:

```javascript
app.post("/test", () => {
  const order = new Order("ITEM-123", 3);
  order.details = "some details";
  return order;
});
```

<br />

They will be part of JSON when retrieved as in standard JavaScript

Terminal:

```shell
> order1
{ id: 'order1', item: 'ITEM-123', qty: 3, details: 'some details' }
```

API:

```javascript
app.get("/test", () => order1);
```

```json
{
  "id": "order1",
  "item": "ITEM-123",
  "qty": 3,
  "details": "some details"
}
```

or can be part of constructor as seen in previous examples

Terminal:

```shell
> class Order {
    constructor(item, qty) {
      this.item = item;
      this.qty = qty;
    }
  }
> new Order("ITEM-123", 3)
{ id: 'order2', item: 'ITEM-123', qty: 3 }
```

API:

```javascript
class Order {
  constructor(item, qty) {
    this.item = item;
    this.qty = qty;
  }
}
nucleoid.register(Order);

app.post("/test", () => new Order("ITEM-123", 3));
```

## Query

Once a class registered, the runtime creates list of instance under its name. For example:

Terminal:

```shell
> class User {
    constructor(username) {
      this.username = username;
      this.active = true;
      this.created = Date.now();
    }
  }
> new User("test")
{ id: 'user0', username: 'test', active: true, created: 1633123200000 }
> User.filter((u) => u.active == true)
[{ id: 'user0', username: 'test', active: true, created: 1633123200000 }]
> User.find((u) => u.username == "test")
[{ id: 'user0', username: 'test', active: true, created: 1633123200000 }]
```

API:

```javascript
class User {
  constructor(username) {
    this.username = username;
    this.active = true;
    this.created = Date.now();
  }
}
nucleoid.register(User);

// Retrieves active users    ðŸ‘‡
app.get("/users", () => User.filter((u) => u.active == true));

// Retrieves the student     ðŸ‘‡
app.get("/users", () => User.find((u) => u.username == "test"));
```

or lodash functions can be used :partying_face:

Terminal:

```shell
> _.map(User, (u) => ({ x: u.username }))
[{ x: 'test' }]
```

API:

```javascript
app.get("/users", () => _.map(User, (u) => ({ x: u.username })));
```

## Scope (API only)

Nucleoid can be used without built-in API routes as well, but in order to do that, outside data needs to pass in as a
scope in your project a call `nucleoid.run( fn )` and it will return the value.

```javascript
const scope = { userId: "USER-1" };
const user = nucleoid.run((scope) => new User(scope.userId), scope);
console.log(user);
```
